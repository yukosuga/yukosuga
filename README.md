# Konnichiwa üëã I'm Yuko üë©üèª‚Äçüíª‚ú®
üå± **Web Designer** currently honing my skills in the exciting world of web development at **DCI** (Digital Career Institute) :octocat:

- With a strong passion for coding and a keen eye for design, I'm on a mission to transform my love for technology into a successful career.

- My journey into web development started at **DCI**, where I'm immersed in a comprehensive curriculum that covers front-end and back-end technologies. From `HTML` and `CSS` to `JavaScript` and beyond, I'm eager to master the building blocks of the web and stay up-to-date with emerging trends and frameworks.

- In addition to my studies, I have hands-on experience with `WordPress`, a powerful content management system. I have successfully built and customized websites using `WordPress`, leveraging its flexibility and extensive plugin ecosystem to create engaging online experiences.
