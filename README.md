🌱 A web designer currently honing my skills in the exciting world of web development at DCI (Digital Career Institute).:octocat:

With a strong passion for coding and a keen eye for design🎨, I'm on a mission to transform my love for technology into a successful career✨

My journey into web development started at DCI, where I'm immersed in a comprehensive curriculum that covers front-end and back-end technologies. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond, I'm eager to master the building blocks of the web and stay up-to-date with emerging trends and frameworks💻

In addition to my studies, I have hands-on experience with WordPress, a powerful content management system. I have successfully built and customized websites using WordPress, leveraging its flexibility and extensive plugin ecosystem to create engaging online experiences🍀
